# Yet Another Silly Atomic Distro

This is an opinionated Fedora Atomic Image made by [Joshua Lee](https://10leej.com) for his desktop system. it is essentially a custom made form the gound up a Fedora Atomic Sway ReSpin as I'm not really rebuilding the Sway image. Instead I'm working ground up from a minimal Fedora image.
It's mostly for his personal use. But we all know he likes to tinker. This is basically intended to be an image that yanks fro his latest dotfiles.
